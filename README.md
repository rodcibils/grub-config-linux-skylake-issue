# grub-config-linux-skylake-issue
Grub config for proper boot of any Linux distro on an Asus R510V or similar PC with Skylake processor

After two weeks of pain, I made it to properly install a Linux Distro on an Asus R510V notebook. 
I installed Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia, but it's possible to install any other distro without a problem editing the grub config file.
If not, the LiveCD freezes on load screen in eternum, with no other escape than force shutdown the computer.
This workaround it's only possible on distros that shows grub screens on LiveCD, if not, another method has to be found.

For that users who fall here, good luck and enjoy Linux!
